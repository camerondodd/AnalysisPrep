# AnalysisPrep

## Summary </br>
An application designed to save hours of prep work before an analysis is run.	It helps the user select the appropriate analysis, check for all assumptions, look up some simple definitions and perform some basic calculcations, all in one place for the first time.

The user lands on the AnalysisFinder, which will give a set of questions one at a time, and lead the user to the analysis they should be running for their data set based on what they want to do with it.  This will also give a comprehensive list of assumptions required for each analysis.

If they have any questions about a particular term, the user can go to the definitions page to find common statistical terms.

Now that the user knows what they have to run, have met all assumptions, and looked up all definitions, the user can use one of a few different calculators to find the required sample size, depending on what information they have available.
